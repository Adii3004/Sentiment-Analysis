# Sentiment Analysis using ESA

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** using Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA). The script is implemented in Python as a Jupyter Notebook (`ESA_final.ipynb`). It analyzes text data to determine the sentiment, leveraging natural language processing techniques.

## Features
- Processes text input to determine sentiment polarity.
- Uses machine learning/NLP techniques to analyze sentiment.
- Can be adapted for various sentiment-related applications.

## Installation

To set up the project, first create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

- python -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\\Scripts\\activate

Then install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook ESA_final.ipynb
- Run the notebook cells to process text and perform sentiment analysis.
